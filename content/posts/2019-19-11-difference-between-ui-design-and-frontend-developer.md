There is a common misconception about UI developers and Front-End developers that they do same job.  And to continue with our UI Design Fundamentals series we need to clear all questions around these two important positions.

## UI Designer 

As I said in the first post of the series:

"The responsibility of the UI Designer is to prepare all the visual elements that are going to create the interface that the user will interact with."

The major goal of the UI Designer is to create a convenient interface and need to think of shapes, shading, consistency and visual appearance.

The UI Designer duty is to make design guidelines in which the developers will work.

And here are some software commonly used by UI Designers:

* <a href="https://www.sketch.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sketch</a>
* <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a>

* <a href="https://webflow.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Webflow</a>

## Frontend Developer

They ought to have the expertise and the capacity to transform the UI configuration given into the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make UI Design a functional product.

The front-end developer likewise comprises the HTTP protocol, the principles of work of servers and browsers, the peculiarities of displaying the web on various devices and they need to keep up the alignment with Back-end developers, providing all information needed.

In general, the last step of a product is done by Front-end developers.

And below are technologies and software commonly used by front-end developers:

* <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HTML</a>
* <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CSS</a>
* <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>
* <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">React</a>
* <a href="https://angular.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Angular</a>
* <a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vue</a>
* <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>
* <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chrome Developer Tools</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

if you're a freelancer and you're building an app or a website to someone, then you're assuming all of these roles.

But for large businesses that have a lot of resources and money to hire out people, they would possibly have:  UX Design, UI Design, Front-end Development, and Back-end Development positions.

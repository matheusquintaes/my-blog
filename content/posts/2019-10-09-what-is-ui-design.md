I am going to start a new series of posts called UI Design Fundamentals on my blog.

**What is this series for?**

This will be a cycle of articles that will point out one of the crucial aspects of UI Design.

If you are a beginner this series is for you. The goal is to teach and help you so that you’ll have a lot more confidence and will also be able to optimise your time and create better designs.

The series was inspired by the content of channel [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow).

The first topic we are going to talk about is:

## UI Design

The UI is an acronym for user interface design.

And for me, the UI is a digital medium that users interact with. (or user interacts with – either or other)

It's a simple definition, although the scope of what it means to be a UI designer isn’t limited to digital. It can also be related to something like a mouse, touchscreens or keyboards.

For me, as a UI Designer for the web, it's the digital medium I work with, usually a screen in the form of a monitor or a phone.

And the responsibility of the UI Designer is to prepare all the visual elements that are going to create the interface that the user will interact with.

So, websites and apps are user interfaces that the person can use to get information and interact with.

## UI vs UX Design

There's a lot of confusion about these two terms, maybe it’s because we didn't have the separation in the past. The industry has grown up and matured, then started to separate different concerns. A UI design is not the same as a UX Design unless the designer understands that both fields are two separate things.

So **UI** (User Interface) **is a visual** (pages, visual elements, screens) and UX (User Experience) **is focused on user experience** while they're interacting with our product or service.

Here are some quotes from the industry that can help and put it in their own words in terms of the difference between UI and UX.

> 1. UX is focused on the user’s journey to solve a problem, UI is focused on how a product’s surfaces look and function

> 2. There is no difference between UX and UI design because they are two things that aren’t comparable to each other

> 3. UI is the bridge that gets us where we want to go, UX is the feeling we get when we arrive.

I hope this article helped you to understand what is the UI Designer and the difference between UI verse UX Design.

In the next article, we are going to talk about the differences between the **UI Designer vs. Frontend Developer.**

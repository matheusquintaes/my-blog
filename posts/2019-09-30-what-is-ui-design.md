The UI is acronym for **user interface** design

and a digital medium that user interacts with.



It's a simple definition 

you know it's a very simple definition although it doesn't in the broader scope of what it means to be a UI designer

 it doesn't just have to be digital it could be something for instance like a keyboard that you're touching 

I could even be based on sound I so but for us we're just gonna say it's a digital medium usually a screen in the form of like a monitor or a tablet or a phone of some sort

 and your role as a UI designer is to prepare all the visual elements that make up that user interface that the person is using

 so a website is a user interface that they can go just to gain information or to interact with 

I'm also an app and so these are all things that you know you as a UI designer would be preparing a very simple conceptual level stuff here 

so what is UI verse UX design

 I wanted to throw this in I simply because there's a lot of confusion sometimes when it comes to these two terms

 I really we didn't have these separations early on back like in the early 2000s or late 90s







but as of course the industry has matured we started to separate these different concerns so I if you're a UI designer you're not a UX designer in vice-versa unless you understand both fields are the two separate things so a UI is a visual I usually usually in a form of screens pages visual elements and such and UX is or user experience design is focused on the users experience while they're interacting with your product or service alright so you as a UI designer you your villain you're dealing with the the visual aspects that you know a person is using on a product or service and the UX is completely not based on just visuals it really has to do with that users experience thus UX design I thought I would throw in also some quotes from industry Chanel's who can also who really put it in their own words in terms of what the difference between UI and UX is so UX is focused on the user's journey to solve a problem and you eyes focused on how a product serves surfaces look in function and that's from Ken Norton UI is the the bridge that gets us where we want to go and UX is the feeling we get when we arrive that's from Jason ogle and one last one a UX designer is concerned with the conceptual aspects of the design process and leaving the UI designer to focus on the more tangible elements and that's from Andy bud all right so hopefully you now have a pretty decent understanding of you know what the difference is between UI verse UX design
